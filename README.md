- 👋 Hi, I’m Shanwen TANG, you can also call me Sherry. I'm Chinese, and now I live in France.
- 👀 I’m interested in: photographing, pets(I'm a cat lover), cooking, travelling, music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: data visualization tools/ French and Japanese/ photographing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: projects involving data analysis, especially those that benefit from visual storytelling. I love creative things.
- 📫 How to reach me : You can email me at shanwen_tang@outlook.com or follow me on LinkedIn at [linkedin.com/in/shanwentang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shanwen-tang-355605257/). 
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- 🐱 Fun fact: I have a British Shorthair cat named Tigre🐯（in French), who is the queen of our home. She's mastered the art of looking utterly unimpressed by my cooking skills, yet she never misses a mealtime. Her majestic presence and quirky personality inspire many of my photographs, making her a celebrity in her own right among my friends.
